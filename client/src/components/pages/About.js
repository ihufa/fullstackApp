        Plants are mans best friends, making oxygen for us all to breathe. But sometimes a plant and its owner can grow apart. 
        This can be a heart breaking situation, and rather than drowning ur plant in a bag in the river, you could swap it for a new one, right here!
      </h3><br/>
      <h3>
        Right now some iphone pictures will turn 90 degrees to the left after being uploaded. On the drop down menu for each plant you can choose 'rotate' and rotate it back up again.
        </h3>
        <br/>
        <h3>
          Right now you cannot upload plant photos using Safari! this is being worked on, but until then please user another browser.
        </h3>

        <h3>
          If there are other bugs, issues or suggestions I would love to hear about it. I will try to make this site into what the users want, so do let me know.
